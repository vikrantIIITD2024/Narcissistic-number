# Narcissistic-number
Hey Amingos, Here i provided an easy explaination of narcissistic number.
The first thing comes in your mind is what is narcissistic number, it may seem like a bit difficult but it's not.
The sum of a number's own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits, is called a narcissistic number. 
Let's understand it with an example: 370
So, lets just focus on the number of digits in the above number i.e., 3 digits
next step would be to calculate every digit's raised the power of number of digits i.e., 3^3 , 7^3 , 0^3
After that we have to add these numbers i.e., 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370
Hence, the above sum of these digits is same as our input digit so, we can say it's narcissistic number.

Example 1:

Input: 370
Explaination: 3^3 + 7^3 + 0^3 = 370
Output: Yes

Input: 9474
Explaination: 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4 = 9474
Output: Yes

Input: 376
Explaination: 3^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 = 586
Output: No


I also provided the code for this in java.
